# ðŸ“ˆ Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on **extracting essential stock and revenue data** for **Tesla ($\text{TSLA}$) and GameStop ($\text{GME}$)**, and then **visualizing** this data. The goal is to demonstrate the process of obtaining financial data using Python libraries (such as $\texttt{yfinance}$ and $\texttt{pandas}$) and displaying it graphically for easy analysis and pattern identification.

***

## Key Features
* **Data Extraction:** Programmatically retrieve historical stock price data (e.g., open, high, low, close) and quarterly revenue data.
* **Data Processing:** Utilize the $\texttt{pandas}$ library for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Visualization:** Generate interactive or static line plots to visualize stock prices and revenue trends over time.
* **Target Stocks:** Focus on $\text{TSLA}$ and $\text{GME}$ to highlight different types of market activity.

***

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **$\text{yfinance}$:** To download historical market data from Yahoo! Finance.
* **Plotly/Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating the data visualizations (specify which library you use).
